Your one-stop guide to the Top Five Football Leagues in the world.

1. Clone the repo or download the zip file to your system
2. Switch to the downloaded folder in the Terminal/Command Prompt and issue an 'npm install' command (node.js should be installed)
3. Update the app/server.js file as per the comments provided in the file:
    Get your free API key from [api.football-data.org/register](http://api.football-data.org/register)
    (I'm not the owner of API. The web app will work fine without an API key as well, although the number of requests allowed will be lesser)
4. Switch to the 'app' directory and issue a 'node server.js' command
5. Kick-off at localhost!
